    <h2>Big Data = Big Analysis</h2>

<p> For my thesis at DSI, I am working with the Indian organization <a href="http://www.springhealth.co.in/"> Spring Health</a>. Their main aim goal and purpose is to provide clean drinking water to rural communities without access to clean freshwater.</p>
<p> Also in this repository is a csv file. I have conducted research with the customers of Spring Health, the ones who need and buy this service. I have also conducted a research process called 'self documentation', where 12 families participated in photographing their daily consumption of this water. I have a lot of data and now I would like to visualize this.</p>
<img src="child.png" alt="Self Documentation" />
<p> I want to make an interactive like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek" >Snowfall</a>. This will include storytelling through pictures and images along with interactive graphs like <a href="http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/14/journalist-deaths/index.html">this one</a>. This will help me tell individual motivations for consumers along with their community beliefs.</p>
<p> I will create this using basic html and some java script. If I can figure out how to write the 'if' and 'else' statements, then I will be able to visualize what i have in mind.
